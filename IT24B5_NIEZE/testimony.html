    <p>Making this webpage had been hard yet enjoyable but learned a lot while doing this, it is hard because it is my first time making this kind of webpage. And i have no idea what to do at first, because it is my first time doing this, and it is important how do use it because it is so difficult. </p>
    <p>I learned how to style it, and make it more presentable webpage. Like I learned how to put background photo to style it. While I'm doing this webpage I also learned the basic concept of CSS and HTML. And I didn't know how to start because this topics is not included in our first year  so it seems to be hard to me like it's my first time. And I struggle a lot but my classmates help and explain it to me step-by-step. </p>
    <p>And I realize how important to know not everything but the basic on how to use HTML and CSS. Annd now I can't imagine that I can make my own webpage it is simple but I try so hard to make this.</p>
    <p>Now I was able to learn the process on how to do it. Including how you design it and how you style my webpage. </p>
